          </h3>
          <p>
            Do you want to plan your own holiday, but need a bit of help during
            your trip? Go Beyond Holidays can provide you with a ‘<span
              class="bold"
              >Travel Buddy</span
            >’ who will join you on your holiday and give you just the right
            amount of support.
          </p>
          <p>
            With our '<span class="bold">Travel Buddy</span>' holidays, you
            choose when and where you wish to go. Your friends can come too if
            you wish. It’s up to you!
          </p>
          <p>We can help with every aspect of your holiday.</p>
          <p>
            What type of holiday would you like? Beach holiday? Sight seeing?
            Touring holiday? Adventure holiday? We can give you as much advice
            as you need.
          </p>
          <p>
            Who do you want on your holiday? Just you? You and a friend or group
            of friends? With a group you have never met before? Let us know, and
            we’ll come up with a plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            We can help to pick your dates, help you to decide the best time to
            go.
          </p>
          <p>
            And we can help you choose your accommodation: hotel, hostel,
            campsite or guesthouse.
          </p>

          <p>
            We can help with ideas of how best to spend your time on your
            holiday. Walking in the hills or sight seeing, shopping or relaxing
            on the beach.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let us book your travel arrangements. By aeroplane, coach, train,
            boat or all of these? We can help you decide.
          </p>

          <p>
            And of course, we’ll provide a travel buddy to help you every step
            of the way. If you wish, your Travel Buddy can support you from the
            departing station or airport or they can even accompany you from
            your front door all the way to your destination. They can support
            you throughout your holiday, with all of the things that you decide
            to do. Then your Buddy will support you back home to your door. You
            can choose.

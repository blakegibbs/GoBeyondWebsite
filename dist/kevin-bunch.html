            Kevin Bunch
          </h2>
          <h2 class="sm-heading">New Client Relations</h2>
          <p>
            Kevin looks after all our UK new enquiries and bookings. Born in
            Birmingham, he studied Travel & Tourism in his home city, before
            heading off travelling for a few weeks. 12 years later (!) Kevin
            returned and made his home in South Wales where he still resides
            with his long-term partner Louise, and his daughter Ffion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kevin’s main responsibilities for us are in the UK, where he is
            often the first point of contact when initial enquiries are made.
            Kevin’s great organisational skills means that all matters regarding
            enquiries, bookings and customer communication are seen to with
            maximum efficiency, plus he loves helping out with brochure design
            and our social media posts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Away from Go Beyond, Kevin also owns a poetry writing company which
            offers bespoke poems for special occasions such as birthdays and
            anniversaries but now specialises in writing wedding speeches and
            wedding vows – all in rhyme! Indeed Kevin’s connection with Go
            Beyond stretches back a long way as we have used his services to
            provide poems for many of our guests over the years and has also
            contributed to some of our promotional video work. His friendship
            with directors Ian and Anna stretches back to the early 1990’s and
            he has been a huge advocate of our work ever since the days of Go
            Provence. Kevin has always championed us and the work we do, even
            joining us on Zoom calls with some of our guests! So, when we were
            looking for someone to join our ranks, with our knowledge of him as
            a person, his background in tourism and just being an all-round nice
            guy, we were delighted when he accepted our offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Kevin’s not working he loves nothing more than spending days
            with his partner, daughter and their rescue greyhound Flo-Jo. He is
            a former DJ so loves his music and is also the most fanatical Aston
            Villa supporter on the planet!

          <h2 class="sm-heading">A Few Questions to Kevin Bunch</h2>
          <h3>What motivates and inspires you?</h3>
          <p>
            My motivation is 100% working in environments that please my
            aesthetic. The notion of ‘find a job that you love, and you’ll never
            work another day in your life’ resonates with me greatly. Therefore,
            when I find something I love doing, that’s all the motivation I
            need.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for what inspires me? Well, in short, words do. I’ll hear great
            words or lines or passages and instantly write them down for
            reference. Words in music especially. Oh, to be a songwriter and
            have thousands of people at concerts bellow your lyrics out like
            their life depends on them…… one day maybe?
          </p>
          <h3>What are your strengths?</h3>
          <p>
            People commend me on my cheery personality, my communication skills
            and timekeeping. I’ll check my phone or emails relentlessly in case
            I’ve missed an important message, and you’ll never find me late for
            anything. I’d rather be twenty minutes early than twenty seconds
            late!
          </p>
          <h3>What about your weaknesses, where do you need support?</h3>
          <p>
            Well, my partner would say it’s checking my phone and emails
            relentlessly and being overly early for everything! But in truth,
            I’m always seeking clarification that I’m doing things well and
            contributing, where I should instead have more belief in my own
            actions.
          </p>
          <h3>What is the highlight of working for Go Beyond Holidays?</h3>
          <p>
            Undoubtedly, my trips away with our guests. Although my main roll
            means that I am busy organising things behind the scenes, when I get
            the opportunity to jump on a trip then I take it! Helsinki was a
            real highlight for me as it’s so fascinating and I also loved
            accompanying a regular guest of ours on a Travel Buddy to Liverpool
            for a weekend of Beatles and Football. We visited many of the Fab
            Four exhibitions and landmarks as well as attending a Premier League
            match at Anfield. Oh, and I must not forget the time we exhibited at
            The Autism & ADHD Show in London to around 4,000 people, which was
            just fabulous!
          </p>
          <h3>Do you have any personal ambitions?</h3>
          <p>
            I guess now I’ve hit half a century, my personal ambitions and
            aspirations are fewer than once were and playing in goal for England
            at Wembley in a World Cup Final probably isn’t going to happen now!
            I always fancied being on Desert Island Discs though and I also love
            to skip, however I still don’t look as cool as I thought I would in
            doing so. Therefore, a definite ambition of mine is to be able to
            skip like a world champion boxer!
          </p>
          <h3>
            Finally, if you were set adrift on a desert island which three
            albums, three films, three books and one luxury would you take?

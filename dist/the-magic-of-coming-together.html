            The Magic of Coming Together
          </h2>
          <p>
            It has been a bumpy time for everyone during the last year. However,
            it has been a rollercoaster ride for people working in the tourism
            industry. A ride mostly taking you downwards and surrounded in thick
            fog. I run a successful supported holiday company for people with
            autism, learning disabilities and other hidden disabilities, and in
            the last 12 months we have only been able to operate 2 holidays. The
            year 2020 was to be our 10-year anniversary and we had put together
            a celebratory holiday program with exciting, cultural and exotic
            destinations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not being able to run our holidays has been a great disappointment
            to us, not just for the financial side but for missing the chance to
            get together with our loyal guests. Over the last 10 years we have
            built up a following of people who come back year after year. I put
            this down to the fact that we see and treat our guests as family and
            friends. We miss each other and look forward to meeting up, spending
            time with one another and exploring together our holiday
            destination. It is a collective experience and we have come to
            realise, that for Neil (fellow director and co founder) and I, our
            holidays have become a form of lifestyle for us. Not having these
            holidays has made us realise what we have, and what it means to us
            and our guests. There has been a sense of mourning or pining among
            all of us.
          </p>
          <p>
            We wanted to address the fact that we haven’t seen many of our
            guests for over a year, so we organised a weekend of Zoom calls,
            which we hadn’t done previously. We scheduled three meetings, all at
            8pm, for one hour, with topics of discussion including, joke of the
            day, funny holiday memories and what you’re doing in the week ahead
            that you are looking forward to. We tried our best to give everyone
            a chance to speak, to talk and to sing even. We had on average of 25
            people per evening, all of our faces appearing on the screen in a
            grid, and after the initial “you’re still on mute” and “you have to
            turn your video on”, banter, we all settled down and it began to
            feel like we were on holiday together again, accept the destination
            was a virtual one. Zoomland.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have had some great feedback about the meetings from the guests,
            their parents and carers and people are asking when the next ones
            will be. We will be slotting these calls in once a month. The value
            of coming together to talk and to see each other is priceless, we
            all received a huge morale boost, which everyone wants in these
            uncertain times.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hopefully we will be able to get together this year in person as
            well and run as many of our 2021 holidays. Not being able to get
            together has taught me the value of collectiveness, how we can take
            being in a group for granted.
          </p>

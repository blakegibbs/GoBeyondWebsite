                    Tracy</h2>
                <h3 class="bold">By Ian Callen – Go Beyond Founder</h3>
                <p>
                    Go Beyond Holidays is now 15 years old. We have facilitated hundreds of supported holidays all over
                    Europe and into Africa. Sometimes, usually whilst supporting our guests on holiday, when sat around
                    a full bustling dinner table and after a full day, I reflect back, to when I first had the idea for
                    supported holidays and smile to myself at how far the idea has come. I would like to share with you
                    how Go Beyond came into being, as more than often, people ask me the question, why did you set up a
                    company that supports people with autism, learning disabilities and other hidden disabilities to
                    travel and have holidays? How did you get here? So here is how Go Beyond was born, a story which
                    begins with a young family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The seed of Go beyond Holidays was planted freely in my head when I was a young man back in 2007. I
                    was living and working in the city of my birth, Bristol, England, married to Anna, with two small
                    children, (who are now in the Go Beyond team!) my dreams still fresh in my mind, waiting to become
                    reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After spending my post education early years, working in insurance and record shops, I lived for
                    three years in St Tropez, France. The combination of the mundane (working in an office), cultural
                    (working in a record shop) and exotica (living in Provence by the Mediterranean) gave me the impetus
                    to want to do something different and useful to society. I was living in the 90’s, a time when you
                    could feel the heat of the final embers of optimism, a time before the world was flooded with an
                    abundance of information ushered in by the internet and smart phones.
                </p>
                <p>I trained in horticulture and conservation, wanting to be close to the land, and after dabbling in
                    landscaping, I trained to be a teacher and was employed by the Brandon Trust, a charity that
                    provides supported living to people with autism and learning disabilities, and I was fortunate
                    enough to be given the opportunity to work in one of their supported employment projects, Elm Tree
                    Farm, teaching horticulture and conservation.</p>
                <p>During my time working for the Brandon Trust, one of my key inspirations was my boss, Tracy Date. She
                    was responsible for developing the education and training facilities ran by Brandon Trust. Tracy
                    immersed me in the world of possibilities and opportunity for people who need a bit of support in
                    life. My new teaching path brought me into touch with the local community. One of our classrooms was
                    at Eastville Park, a large Victorian park with many conservation projects that we joined and we met
                    many local groups. It was also a fertile time in my life for ideas, and any idea that I put forward
                    to Tracy, she would come back to me and say, ‘cost it up and if we can afford it, go for it!!’.</p>
                <p>Pretty much every idea I proposed Tracy gave me the green light. With this support from Tracy, the
                    possibilities and opportunities opened up for me and my students. Together we organised a farmers
                    market, a photography exhibition, help to restore an old swimming pool area into a garden, joined a
                    tawny owl project, made bird boxes for the local park, organised an open air carol service and
                    tellingly, a wildlife holiday to St Davids in Pembrokeshire, Wales. This holiday we had, in a cold
                    February, perhaps sowed the seeds for Go Beyond. I remember, to keep the costs down for the trip, we
                    proposed to the manager of the hostel in St Davids that we could do some gardening work in exchange
                    for letting us stay. He agreed and we worked two days clearing brambles in and around the old hostel
                    in very cold temperatures, but sharp blue skies, together with hot drinks to keep us happy and warm.
                </p>
                <p>What emerged during this week away was an element that I noticed was absent from our normal sessions
                    at the farm. It was like a community spirit, or a comradery that comes with being together all day
                    for a period of time. Eating, sleeping, getting out in the countryside, working together, joking
                    around and being silly, and best of all, talking. Talking about nothing, talking about important
                    issues, having a time together that gives spaces for conversations to wander here, there and
                    everywhere, that we couldn’t get to, in our classes back in Bristol.</p>
                <p>The time came when my family and I had made the big decision to move to France. Anna and I had found
                    work at an international school in Provence, a school set up to support kids with dyslexia and other
                    challenging behaviours. It was a dream chance for us. We were very excited.</p>
                <p>During the last few days at Elm Tree Farm, many of the students would come in to the classroom, a
                    wooden shed, to wish me luck, ‘au revoir’, they would warmly smile and ‘Bonne Chance Ian’. I would
                    always thank them and say ‘you will have to come down and visit, Provence is a beautiful place with
                    lots to see and the sun is always shining’. After saying this a few times, the idea struck me, like
                    a bolt from the heavens, of course a group could come down and visit, on holiday, together with
                    support, like the St Davids holiday’. And there the idea was planted and it waited for the right
                    time to germinate and grow.</p>
                <p>After a couple of years living in France, the school where Anna and I worked, closed. In France, if
                    you are made unemployed, the state will match your salary for a year to help you stay on your feet.
                    We used this time to weigh up our options. Should we move back to England? Should we look for work
                    in France? What could we do? This is when I shone the ‘supported holiday’ idea with light, brought
                    it out into the open, talking it over with Anna and friends, how it could work. We decided to run a
                    pilot holiday, to see how it would work. We got in touch with some of my ex students from Elm Tree
                    Farm to see if there was any interest in a holiday in Provence, in and around the area where I now
                    lived, called the gorges du Verdon. Seven former students wanted to come down and visit and were
                    happy to be holiday ‘guinea pigs’.</p>
                <p>A warm July week, back in 2009, was spent together in a gite in a small village, called Quinson, and
                    this is where Go Beyond, or Go Provence as we were known then, was born. It would take a few years
                    for us to find our shape, and Provence was such a good place for us to ‘get good’ at organising and
                    delivering supported holidays.</p>
                <p>There have been many people over the years who have supported us and made us who we are today, but
                    one pillar that stands out, is my supportive boss back at Brandon Trust, Tracy Date, who inspired me
                    to believe that anything was possible and now, some fifteen years on, I couldn’t have dreamed how
                    far we’ve come and the number of guests we’ve welcomed and supported. As George Michael once said to
                    me “Ian, turn a different corner and we never would have met”. I’m so glad I turned the right corner
                    to be introduced to Tracy and The Brandon Trust and the path my life has taken since.</p>
                <p>Thanks Tracy. </p>

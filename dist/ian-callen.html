          </h2>
          <h2 class="sm-heading">Director and Co-founder</h2>
          <p>
            Ian Callen is the founder and one of the directors of Go Beyond. He
            has lived in France for over 18 years and has been a qualified
            teacher since 2007. Ian knows the region extremely well and spends
            his spare time climbing, walking and photographing the Gorges du
            Verdon. He also presents a fortnightly radio show local to the area,
            Radio Verdon, a show that celebrates British music. Ian has also
            president and founder of, Good Shot, which is a charity which
            encourages people to get outside with their cameras and highlights
            the work of local photographers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ian worked at The Olive Tree International School teaching
            photography, horticulture, conservation, biology and astronomy to
            children with challenging behaviour. In Bristol, England Ian worked
            for the Brandon Trust, teaching conservation and horticulture to
            people with learning disabilities. He lives with his wife, Anna, and
            three children, Joseph, Jasmine and Poppy, in the Provencal town of
            Manosque.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ian has a City & Guilds teaching qualification, RHS General and
            Advanced certificates in horticulture. Ian is trained in First Aid
            to British Red Cross Standard (January 2019). Ian also has training
            in Epilepsy and Midazolam, Safeguarding Vulnerable Adults and the
            Mental Capacity Act.

          <h2 class="sm-heading">A Few Questions to Ian Callen</h2>
          <h3>What motivates and inspires you?</h3>
          <p>
            To find the beauty or positives in a challenging circumstance or
            difficult situation. Living here in Provence is very inspiring, the
            landscape, nature and people that I meet are triggers to new ideas
            that usually get filtered into Go Beyond somehow. I love working on
            an idea that I can trace it’s root to the moment it was born. For
            example, the idea for supported holidays came in the shed/classroom
            when I was working for the Brandon Trust, teaching at Elm Tree Farm
            in Bristol. Here we are fifteen years down the line.
          </p>
          <h3>What are your strengths?</h3>
          <p>
            Obstacles don’t bother me, they only make me more determined to get
            something finished. I enjoy the struggle to achieve a goal and I
            love seeing others achieve too, Go Beyond gives me a great platform
            to help others realise their dreams and goals. We had a client on
            holiday with us, Ed, a great photographer, who had won awards for
            his work but couldn’t find anyone to give him wall space for an
            exhibition. When he was with us, we arranged with a local restaurant
            owner, Jean Jacques, in Moustiers Sainte-Marie, for an exhibition to
            take place in his restaurant, Le Belvedere. We had an opening
            evening, the local press turned up and Ed sold five photos. As you
            can imagine Ed was a very happy man, and all of this happened whilst
            Ed was on holiday with us. I love all that, ideas coming from
            nothing.
          </p>
          <h3>What about your weaknesses, where do you need support?</h3>
          <p>
            You will probably have to speak to my wife for that one, or the rest
            of the Go Beyond team. I sometimes get overtaken by an idea, so
            Anna, my wife, helps me to keep my feet on the ground. I can come
            across as too serious, but that is usually because I have a lot of
            things to think about. If that happens, just give me a friendly
            punch and tell me a joke, I always have time for a joke and that
            grumpy look will soon disappear.
          </p>
          <h3>What is the highlight of working for Go Beyond Holidays?</h3>
          <p>
            Without a doubt the people that I spend time with and the
            environment I spend it in, with them.
          </p>
          <h3>Do you have any personal ambitions?</h3>
          <p>
            To become a better photographer and write a nature book on the
            Gorges du Verdon.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Finally, if you were set adrift on a desert island which three
            albums, three films, three books and one luxury would you take?
          </h3>
          <p>
            For music, very difficult as I would want to take a 100 records with
            me but I would take, ‘Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill’, by Grouper.
            ‘Green’, by REM and ‘Carrie & Lowell’, by Sufjan Stevens. If I could
            take a fourth it would be ‘Slowdive’, by Slowdive. My books would be
            ‘The Pilgrimage’, by Paulo Coelho, ‘Sweet Thursday’, by John
            Stienbeck and Bram Stoker’s ‘Dracula’. My films are Interstellar,
            The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and Donnie Darko. A luxury would be
            my camera.

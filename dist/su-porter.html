            Su Porter
          </h2>
          <p>
            Su Holborn lives in Devon sandwiched between the open vistas of
            Dartmoor and the stunning South Devon coast, both of these being
            visited regularly for work and play. During her career in education,
            she worked with all ages and abilities in a variety of environments.
            Su trained as a PE Teacher, became an international Outward Bound
            tutor, teacher, youth leader, a wife and mother, Professional
            Mountaineer, University Lecturer and has recently retired. For over
            20 years at Marjon, Plymouth, Su taught, coached, and nurtured her
            students’ talents, affectionately known as the Outdoor Adventure Mum
            to all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Su may have stopped working full time but she became self-employed
            continuing to work with National Organisations to develop future
            outdoor instructors and more locally for a friend on school
            residential courses, Duke of Edinburgh’s Award and other group
            residentials, which is how she became involved with Go Beyond,
            Dartmoor 2021.

          <h2 class="sm-heading">A Few Questions to Su Porter</h2>
          <h3>What motivates and inspires you?</h3>
          <p>
            Sharing my love of the outdoors with others. Seeing people enjoy the
            little things it has to offer, to greater adventures. Enabling
            others to achieve their potential, seeking out what is possible in a
            safe and supported way.
          </p>
          <h3>What are your strengths?</h3>
          <p>
            I am a thinker and a doer, many years running a successful Outdoor
            Adventure Programme means I am patient, a problem solver and
            puzzler. Always looking for a positive outcome, a new way to
            approach given situations. Working with people, observing their
            abilities and how these might be developed, in a positive, enjoyable
            and fulfilling way.
          </p>
          <h3>What about your weaknesses, where do you need support?</h3>
          <p>
            My weakness is that I can try to do too much and I have to reign
            myself in or someone has to do it for me. I think I can multi task
            but sometimes I have one too many tasks on the go at once. I am
            pretty good at forgetting my own stuff at times, so focussed on
            everyone else!
          </p>
          <h3>What is the highlight of working for Go Beyond Holidays?</h3>
          <p>
            The people, guests and staff alike. The fun we have, the friends we
            make.
          </p>
          <h3>Do you have any personal ambitions?</h3>
          <p>To never grow old in my outlook on life!</p>
          <h3>
            Finally, if you were set adrift on a desert island which three
            albums, three films, three books and one luxury would you take?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Albums – Darkside of the Moon, Led Zeppelin IV, Hotel California
          </p>
          <p>Films – Local hero, Ghost, Schindler’s List</p>
          <p>
            Books – The Tanglewood’s Secret, The Call of the Wild, The Little
            Prince
          </p>
          <p>
            Luxury – A notebook that never ends. (I can make charcoal for a
            pencil)

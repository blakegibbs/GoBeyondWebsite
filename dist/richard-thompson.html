          </h2>
          <h2 class="sm-heading">Non-Executive Director</h2>
          <p>
            Richard’s vision, knowledge, passion and commitment for making
            travel accessible and inclusive, everywhere, to everyone, is world
            renowned. His unique capacity to educate and enlighten sought around
            the globe.
          </p>
          <p>
            And his is an epic journey. A fusion of independent exploration
            across more than 70 countries, four decades of tourism industry
            experience and half a lifetime turning adversity to advantage
            following his own life-changing changing personal injury. Over the
            past 22 years, Richard has defined the ‘accessible’ market and
            redefined what is possible, crafting journeys of discovery – close
            to home and on distant shores, that rekindle travel ambitions and
            realise ‘impossible’ dreams, however complex a persons additional
            requirements might be and wherever in the world they want to go. It
            is motivating and inspiring. And we are all motivated and inspired.
          </p>
          <h2 class="sm-heading">A Few Questions to Richard Thompson</h2>
          <h3>What motivates and inspires you?</h3>
          <p>
            I’ve had so many amazing experiences in my life and travelled in
            more than 70 countries. I also understand how traumatic injury (I
            broke my neck whilst working in the French Alps) can have a dramatic
            impact on people’s lives – the injured person and of course those
            that know and love them. So I am motivated to make the world
            accessible and inclusive to everyone, so that whatever anyone’s
            requirements might be, they can enjoy and benefit from the wonders,
            the joys, the fun, the character building, the camaraderie and the
            memory-making opportunities that I have been able to experience. So
            with the amazing team here at Go Beyond, I am constantly inspired
            and motivated to create ever-more exciting holiday options, often
            ground-breaking, always amazing! So the journey continues. Watch
            this space!
          </p>

          <h3>What are your strengths?</h3>
          <p>
            I can see round corners! What I mean by that is I have an instinct
            for what is possible. Not what is happening now, but what will
            happen if we really believe in our dreams. What we can achieve if
            others can also see and share in a vision and who want to work as a
            team, recognising that we all have strengths and weaknesses, that we
            can all bring something unique and special to every situation.
            Working together to build rafts to take into the Verdon Gorge comes
            to mind! My mind can be overactive! This means that I am constantly
            coming up with new ideas.
          </p>
          <h3>What about your weaknesses, where do you need support?</h3>
          <p>
            My mind can be overactive! This means that I am constantly coming up
            with new ideas. This can often prove challenging for those around me
            so I definitely need people like Ian and Neil around me who can
            bring some order to my ‘spaghetti’ thinking. They are very organised
            and I absolutely need that ‘safety net’. I can thrive on chaos… but
            that’s not fair on others! Working together – great teamwork, means
            that we are almost always able to realise to our objectives and if
            we don’t, it’s never failure… we only fail if we give up, and we
            will still have learned a lot. That’s a great lesson in life.
          </p>
          <h3>What is the highlight of working for Go Beyond Holidays?</h3>
          <p>
            Just being one cog in the wheel that Ian and Neil turn to create
            what are without question the most incredible holidays on the
            planet. I feel honoured to be able to contribute and excited by the
            many possibilities for worldwide travel adventures that we can and
            will create over the coming years.
          </p>
          <h3>Do you have any personal ambitions?</h3>
          <p>
            To spend more time creating objects that are either pleasing to the
            eye or useful, or better still, both!
          </p>
          <h3>
            Finally, if you were set adrift on a desert island which three
            albums, three films, three books and one luxury would you take?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Ooh, this is a difficult one. So many soundtracks to my life but I
            would have to go for the music of the Seventies. Definitely ‘Dark
            Side of the Moon’ from Pink Floyd (my hippy youth!), ‘Blue’ from one
            of the greatest song-writers – Joni Mitchell and Harvest from her
            male counterpart, Neil Young.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m not a great reader (too busy writing my own story!) but one book
            that really inspired my (not surprisingly) is ‘Thriving on Chaos’ by
            business guru, Tom Peters and ‘Full Tilt’ from one of the greatest
            explorers of our age, Dervla Murphy – it’s the story of her epic
            ride from Ireland to India by bicycle!
          </p>
          <p>
            Movies – I’m a romantic comedy fan, so either Love Actually or The
            Holiday. And the first ever ‘documentary-drama’ from 1934 – The Man
            of Aran. A gritty portrayal of how brutal life can be in the remote,
            storm battered island off the remote west coast of Ireland.
          </p>
          <p>A luxury – definitely my iPad… wifi included of course!</p>

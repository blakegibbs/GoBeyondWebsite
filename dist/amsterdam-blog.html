            Van Gogh, Canals and Dutch Pancakes
          </h2>
          <h3 class="bold">By Charlotte Archer</h3>
          <p>
            Hello everyone, I’m Charlotte and I recently went on a Travel Buddy
            Holiday to Amsterdam! This was my third Travel Buddy Holiday, after
            Barcelona and Vienna, and holidays in Dartmoor and Galicia. But
            that’s a different story.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any Go Beyond Holiday really starts when Ian makes the WhatsApp
            Group so we can all keep in contact. Then it’s just a small matter
            of getting your suitcase packed. It was great getting to see Su
            again! With Su’s support, I coped with the airport, the airplane, my
            nerves…
          </p>
          <p>
            And then our adventure in Amsterdam began! Su helped me to get out
            of the airport and onto the train into the centre of the city. The
            weather was so lovely and warm as we went on our canal trip. Su
            pointed out what the guides told us about so I could see them too.
            This was a lovely introduction to Amsterdam, and already ticking one
            item off my list!
          </p>
          <p>
            The next day started bright and early as we were going to the Van
            Gogh Museum! A tram ride and some breakfast pastries later (Dutch
            apple cake is delicious!), then onto see some of the most impressive
            paintings of an iconic artist. I was so inspired I did my own
            drawing too! After, we went to the Canal Museum. This explored
            Amsterdam’s history and why Amsterdam has canals. I also ate some
            yummy Dutch pancakes – I’m getting to grips with Dutch cuisine!
          </p>
          <p>
            Our third day, we spent the morning at the Nemo Science Museum. The
            exhibits were hands on and interactive, and they really bring
            science to life! I spent most of my morning in the Human Biology
            section exploring how the body and brain works. In the afternoon we
            visited the Anne Frank House, which was a fitting tribute to Anne
            and those who had their lives cruelly snatched away from them. For
            dinner, we went to a Dutch restaurant and had authentic Dutch
            cuisine – Stamppot. This is mashed potatoes and meat or vegetables,
            and is delicious.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our fourth day, in the morning we had a Walking Tour of Amsterdam,
            where our guide pointed out places of interest. This was so
            interesting, I could have had a longer walk! And for lunch, I tried
            Bitteballen. These are little balls of beef in gravy and a roux
            sauce, then deepfried in breadcrumbs. My last afternoon, I went to
            Body Worlds to see more about the human body. We explored how
            happiness and being happy impacts us. There were more hands on
            activities here such as taking your blood pressure, which Su helped
            me with. We even saw the blood vessels of a duck! Su also helped me
            find De Prael, a bar the tour guide had mentioned on the walking
            tour. Its run and staffed entirely by people who are disabled or
            mentally ill, helping them to work and contribute to society. And
            then to find my final bit of Dutch cuisine – tasty stroopwaffle!
          </p>
          <p>
            On the final morning before going to the airport we walked around
            Amsterdam one final time. We found a water fountain which changes
            how it spurts out water. Then back to the airport, the plane ride,
            and back home!
          </p>
          <p>I cannot wait for Brittany this Summer!</p>
          <p>See you then!</p>

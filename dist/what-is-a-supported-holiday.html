            What's it all about?
          </h3>
          <p>We all need support in certain aspects of our lives.</p>
          <p>
            Some people need help in the areas of their social life perhaps due
            to a learning disability, or a condition like ASD, Autism Spectrum
            Disorder, or maybe in areas linked to anxiety.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many reasons why you may need support and help in social
            situations of life.
          </p>
          <p>
            This extends to support whilst on holiday and travelling. At Go
            Beyond Holidays we view a supported holiday as starting from the
            moment a guest and their support network (this can include any one
            or all of the following; family, friends and professional social
            care) get in touch for more details about our supported holidays.
          </p>
          <p>
            We work closely with the guest’s support network, using clear
            communication to build our care plans and risk assessments to ensure
            that the supported holiday for the guest is fun, memorable, and
            safe.
          </p>

            Book your supported holiday with us
          </h2>

          <p>
            Once a supported holiday is booked with us, we guide our guests
            through areas of travel insurance, itinerary’s, kit lists, flights
            and financial protection. We meet our guests at a UK airport, and
            from here we support them through security and into the departure
            lounge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here our guests are supported to relax whilst we wait for our gate
            to be called or browse the shops. When our gate is called, we
            support our guests on to the aeroplane and into their seat. We do
            our best to ensure that our group is sitting all together, but this
            isn’t always possible depending on when you have booked. Our team
            support guests on to the flight to the destination airport.
          </p>

          <p>
            On arrival, together we go through passport control and collect our
            luggage. Then we head to our accommodation via our mini buses or
            taxi. We repeat our support and this process for the return journey.
          </p>

            Your supported holiday accommodation
          </h2>

          <p>
            Once at the accommodation and we are settled in, then the ‘supported
            holiday’ properly begins. Our support during the holiday includes
            our support team always being present. We may share a room with
            guests if support is needed during the night. Medication will be
            stored away in a safe place and administered by our staff using MARS
            sheets. Guests are supported throughout the holiday to be dressed
            accordingly to the climate and the activity. Guests are supported on
            the activities and visits as the supported holiday progresses. We
            also support guests, if required, with money and currencies, and any
            purchases they wish to make. There may be other individual support
            needs, that care plans and risk assessments highlight that we ensure
            are in place.
          </p>

          <p>
            During the supported holiday, we create a Whats App group for
            guests, Go Beyond team and the guests support network. This enables
            us all to stay in touch with each other, share photos and comments
            and reassuring families and friends. It also keeps everyone up to
            date with any possible travel disruption that may occur.
          </p>

          <p>
            A supported holiday is a process that begins with an email or phone
            call and we hope ends with an embrace and a fond farewell after a
            wonderful experience together.

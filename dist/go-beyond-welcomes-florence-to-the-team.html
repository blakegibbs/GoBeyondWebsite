            By Florence Voller - Marketing and Engagement Lead.
          </h3>

          <p>
            Hello everyone! I’m the newest member of the team, having joined in
            September as the Marketing and Engagement Lead — and here’s a little
            about my journey so far.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’ve worked in support and care services for over 20 years with
            adults with learning disabilities, autism and complex needs.
            Although I graduated with an art degree and always felt drawn to
            creative roles, I also knew I wanted to work closely with people.
            Thinking creatively and approaching challenges from different angles
            has been a constant thread throughout my career — and something I’ve
            always enjoyed.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2011, I joined a London-based charity and worked across a variety
            of roles before going on to develop two services from the ground up.
            One of these was Nutley Edge Activity Breaks, a supported respite
            holiday service — and this is where I discovered my niche. It was
            the perfect blend of support, creativity and variety, and it was
            incredibly rewarding to see the service grow from a concept into a
            programme delivering more than 20 holidays a year. I even managed to
            weave in plenty of art workshops, ensuring that each break was as
            memorable as possible. And of course, being “paid” to test out the
            zip wire first, spend the day exploring an ancient castle, or meet
            some rather charming owls was definitely a bonus!
          </p>

          <p>
            After ten years of running the holidays, it felt like the right time
            for a new chapter. Earlier this year, my partner and I left the UK
            for our own adventure, embracing travel and remote working. Still
            wanting to remain within the world of support, I began working as a
            freelance consultant, specialising in helping organisations
            strengthen their marketing, manage projects, and develop accessible
            tools within the charity sector, supported holidays and accessible
            travel industries for neurodiverse travellers. My experience in
            building and running services has proven invaluable — and now I have
            the privilege of helping other organisations do the same.
          </p>

          <p>
            Years ago, I supported a couple of people to attend holidays with Go
            Beyond (back when they were Go Provence), and I always admired their
            approach. So earlier this year, I reached out to Ian to see if there
            were any opportunities… and, as they say, the rest is history!
          </p>

          <p>
            It’s wonderful to be part of the team and to continue combining two
            of my greatest passions: exploring the world and supporting people.
            Working with individuals and families to help someone have the best
            holiday possible is such a joy — and truly, in my opinion, one of
            the best jobs there is.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’m really looking forward to joining a few Go Beyond holidays in
            2026, meeting guests, and capturing the holiday spirit with my
            camera. My phone is already full of photos, and I can’t wait to add
            many more!
          </p>

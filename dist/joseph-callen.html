            Joseph Callen
          </h2>
          <p>
            Joseph has grown up with Go Beyond Holidays. He was there from the
            start, being the eldest child of Directors Ian and Anna.
          </p>
          <p>
            Go Beyond has always been a family affair, and guests who’ve been
            coming since 2010 will have seen Joseph grow up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having joined the team as a 16-year-old back in 2019, Joseph has
            become part of the furniture. Now finishing his Geography degree at
            Exeter University, he’s planning to head to Edinburgh or London for
            a master’s in green finance or international political economy.

          <h2 class="sm-heading">A Few Questions to Joseph Callen</h2>
          <h3>What motivates and inspires you?</h3>
          <p>
            Understanding how the world works and exploring different nations
            and cultures.
          </p>
          <h3>What are your strengths?</h3>
          <p>
            With having attended different schools, being at a boarding house,
            and my school years coming to an end, I would like to consider
            myself as a social individual and capable of interacting with ease,
            whoever the person. I am also bilingual in French and English, so
            one of my main strengths would be being able to learn, write, and
            interact in both languages.
          </p>

          <h3>What is the highlight of working for Go Beyond Holidays?</h3>
          <p>
            My highlight is being able to volunteer for a cause where one can
            enjoy teamwork, cooperation and the will to make the guests feel as
            confident as possible and have them experience new opportunities,
            all the while having a good laugh.
          </p>
          <h3>Do you have any personal ambitions?</h3>
          <p>
            As for now, I would like to complete my coming uni studies and look
            forward to meeting with new people. I would aspire to travel and
            live and settle abroad (where exactly is unknown as of now).
          </p>
          <h3>
            Finally, if you were set adrift on a desert island which three
            albums, three films, three books and one luxury would you take?

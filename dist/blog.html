                    By Kevin Bunch – New Client Relations - Taking a break from
                    our busy holiday schedule, last month we headed over to the
                    capital for the London Autism & ADHD Show. This was our
                    second time exhibiting at the event and despite the change
                    in venue from Excel at Victoria Dock to The Business Design
                    Centre in Islington, it was once again a huge success for
                    us.

                    recently went on a Travel Buddy Holiday to Amsterdam! This
                    was my third Travel Buddy Holiday, after Barcelona and
                    Vienna, and holidays in Dartmoor and Galicia. But that’s a

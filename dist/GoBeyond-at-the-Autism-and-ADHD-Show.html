                <p>
                    Taking a break from our busy holiday schedule, last month we headed over to the capital for the London Autism & ADHD Show. This was our second time exhibiting at the event and despite the change in venue from Excel at Victoria Dock to The Business Design Centre in Islington, it was once again a huge success for us.

                <p>
                    It’s fair to say that last year was more about ‘dipping our toe in the water’ when it came to promoting ourselves at national events. Previously, we’ve targeted individual groups or organisations to present to, but such has been our growth in recent years, we felt the desire to open Go Beyond up to a larger audience. We were very happy with our stand in 2024 but also felt we could do more, so for months leading up to this year’s exhibition we were busy putting together a stand that would really hit the mark. When planning the design of our allocated space, we wanted to encapsulate everything Go Beyond sets out to achieve; dedicated professionalism mixed with what we’re renowned for, inclusivity and fun! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you can see from the pictures, we went for a lectern style desk with one of our favourite images from last year adorning the front, which sat in front of a huge three metre canvas backdrop of a photo that has become synonymous with Go Beyond Holidays in recent times. It was the photo we call ‘Group Hug’ which was taken in Scotland last October.  Added to this, we had printed on boards some guest and parent testimonials with a further selection of photos, taken over the past fifteen years of us providing supported holidays, mixed in. Finally, we had two eight foot flags standing proudly at the entrance of our stand meaning no-one was going to miss us! 
                </p>
                <p>The day before departing for London, we felt it a sensible idea to practise assembling everything in my house back in south Wales. The look on my partner’s face as she came in from work to see Ian and myself slightly hot and bothered, wearing white gloves (so as not to mark the merchandise!), whilst trying to get to grips with erecting the main display was a real picture and in her words, we reminded her of the Chuckle Brothers - cheeky!</p>

                <img class="blog-image" src="img/blog/autism show/Austism Show - 2025 - Stand Only.jpeg" alt="">
                <p style="font-size: 13px; color: rgb(88, 87, 87); text-align: center;">Our stand at the show we were so proud of!</p>
                
                <p>However, what we believe really set our stand out from all others was that manning our area, we welcomed two of our regular guests to join us. I mean, who better to tell everyone about our trips away than people who actually go away on our trips! Both Amelia and Aidan were a real hit and along with Ian (founder and company director), Jess (one of our wonderful holiday support staff), Rachel (one of our amazing volunteers) plus myself, we really did achieve our goals and had a stand that we were hugely proud of and generated many comments from visitors who loved it too!</p>
                <p>The exhibition, held over two sweltering hot days on June 20th – 21st, showcased many businesses, charitable organisations, guest speakers, workshops and one to one clinics, hosting an array of specialist products and services. Our main aim in attending the show was to spread the word of supported travel and promote ourselves as an industry leader in this field. An estimated 4,000 people were predicted to have come through the doors over the course of the show and we loved chatting with individuals and groups, many of which had their eyes opened to the world of supported travel (especially outside of the UK), for the very first time. On such a hot weekend (temperatures reached over thirty degrees outside and it felt even hotter inside!) we made sure we all had regular breaks where we encouraged everyone to take the opportunity to explore other parts of the show and mix with likeminded organisations who were exhibiting. Included, was visiting old friends such as The Autism Eye stand. Myself in particular enjoyed this, as although I’d shared many an email and phone conversation with Mark their publisher, had never met him face-to-face before. Mark and his team are continual supporters of Go Beyond Holidays and it was great for me to finally put a face to the voice! 
                </p>
                <p>Also, a marvellous, yet somewhat unexpected highlight for us, was meeting up with ‘Options’, another travel company who were also attending. Jack, who mainly looks after all their planning and marketing, was wonderful to chat with as we exchanged stories of our experiences and joy of offering supported holidays. Ian especially enjoyed meeting Jack saying, “Options are one of the leading supported holiday providers in the UK, so it was a pleasure to spend some time with Jack, whose grandmother, set Options up over 40 years ago.  What I liked most was that Jack and I got on so well, and I would like to think that although Options and Go Beyond may be seen as rivals in the supported holiday world, we are now also firm friends.”</p>

                <p>So, to summarise, the event was an overwhelming success and all the planning and graft putting the stand together was 100% worth it and the many new contacts and new friends made over the course of the two days should serve us well going forward. But more than anything, being in an environment that really showcased the fantastic work that goes on to support people with autism and ADHD was a delight and meeting so many wonderful people over the two days of exhibiting shall be remembered by us all for a long time to come. </p>
                <p>As for 2026? Well, there’s certainly interest for us to go again, but we will need to see when the dates are and if we can arrange around our scheduled holidays next year. We’re offering more holidays and more places than ever before and as we put the final touches to our 2026 brochure (out this September!) we are literally buzzing with excitement to see what new experiences and fun lies ahead amidst the continued growth of Go Beyond Holidays.</p>

            Jasmine Callen
          </h2>
          <p>
            Jasmine has grown up with Go Beyond Holidays. She was there at the
            beginning, being Director’s Ian and Anna’s daughter, as a cheerful 4
            year old, with lots of smiles for our guests.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now a slightly more mature 19 year old, she is studying marine and
            Natural History photography at Falmouth University. Jasmine‘s
            biggest passion is photography, and hopes to one day be a
            photographer. She also enjoys diving, rockpooling, climbing, reading
            and listening to music.

          <h2 class="sm-heading">A Few Questions to Jasmine Callen</h2>
          <h3>What motivates and inspires you?</h3>
          <p>
            The endless possibilities of creativity and beauty the world holds.
          </p>
          <h3>What are your strengths?</h3>
          <p>
            Having attended an international school, I am open minded and
            curious about other ways of living. I am very patient, a good
            listener and like having a laugh. I am good at finding solutions to
            problems, and can stay calm in stressful situations
          </p>
          <h3>What about your weaknesses, where do you need support?</h3>
          <p>I’m sometimes not very good at timing my jokes.</p>
          <h3>What is the highlight of working for Go Beyond Holidays?</h3>
          <p>
            The highlight of working for Go Beyond is undeniably seeing the joy
            everyone feels during the holiday and having the constant air of
            happiness all around.
          </p>
          <h3>Do you have any personal ambitions?</h3>
          <p>
            To become an artist able to produce beautiful imagery would be the
            ultimate dream. I would love to specialise in underwater
            photography, spending hours a day diving and snorkelling.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Finally, if you were set adrift on a desert island which three
            albums, three films, three books and one luxury would you take?

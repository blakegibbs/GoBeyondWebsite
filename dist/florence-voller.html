            Florence Voller
          </h2>
          <p>
            Florence joined Go Beyond as our Marketing & Engagement lead in
            September 2025. With a background in running supported respite
            holidays for adults with learning disabilities and autism, she has
            worked in support and care services for over 20 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Florence is also a freelance consultant, specialising in innovative
            project management and creating ‘easy read’ documents for businesses
            within the travel industry to promote inclusivity and accessibility
            for neurodiverse individuals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Florence has a degree in Contemporary Textile Practices and does
            photography in her spare time. Having lived in London for many
            years, she and her partner left the UK in June 2025 to travel the
            world for a while and explore new shores.

          <h2 class="sm-heading">A Few Questions to Florence Voller</h2>
          <h3>What motivates and inspires you?</h3>
          <p>
            People, you can learn so much from others and I have found over the
            years of working within disability services that so many have been
            an inspiration to me. It is an honor and a joy to have worked with
            so many amazing characters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Music also motivates and inspires me, Download Festival is one of my
            annual highlights!
          </p>
          <h3>What are your strengths?</h3>
          <p>
            I’m not great at talking about my own strengths, so I asked my
            partner: he said I’m compassionate, grounded and loyal. A creative
            yet practical thinker and a natural nurturer. More than anything I
            am a people person who loves helping everyone feeling comfortable
            and supported.
          </p>
          <h3>What about your weaknesses, where do you need support?</h3>
          <p>
            I also asked my partner this question too! He said that I am too
            modest and can overthink things…I would say that's half right!
          </p>
          <h3>What is the highlight of working for Go Beyond Holidays?</h3>
          <p>
            The guests first and foremost but also the travel. I am looking
            forward to exploring new places and supporting people to get the
            most out of their holiday, as that is one of the most rewarding
            feelings there is.
          </p>
          <h3>Do you have any personal ambitions?</h3>
          <p>
            I would like to explore photography more, taking photographs feels
            like a natural impulse to me and I’d love to make that a more
            permanent part of my every day.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Finally, if you were set adrift on a desert island which three
            albums, three films, three books and one luxury would you take?
          </h3>
          <p class="bold">Albums:</p>
          <p>
            Can I only pick 3? What if I left the books behind?! This is hard as
            I love so many bands, but I think it would be How the West Won by
            Led Zeppelin, The Black Album by Metallica and The Colour and the
            Shape by the Foo Fighters.
          </p>
          <p class="bold">Three films:</p>
          <p>The Departed, Little Miss Sunshine and Point Break</p>
          <p class="bold">Books:</p>
          <p>
            Lord of the Rings, The Time Traveller's wife and To Kill a
            Mockingbird
          </p>
          <p class="bold">Luxury item:</p>
          <p>
            A radio (preferably digital so I can listen to Planet Rock and
            Kerrang!)

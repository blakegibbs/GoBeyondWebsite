                <p>
                    Football has become a cultural mainstay in our lives.  From the global appeal of the Premier League to the upsurge in popularity of women’s football, it appears we cannot get enough of the beautiful game.  But probably no country does football better than our Spanish neighbours, boasting two of the greatest clubs to ever grace a pitch – Barcelona and Real Madrid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We know we have plenty of football fans who regularly come on our holidays, and they have inspired us to create this holiday that brings with it the opportunity to visit both these cities and experience the wonder of their respective stadiums.  Therefore, we invite you to join us to discover the majestic Stadium Camp Nou, home of the Catalonian giants in Barcelona and the recently renovated Bernabéu Stadium, home of ‘Los Galácticos’, Real Madrid. Both these stadiums are colossal with capacities of over 85,000 and architecturally so impressive, yet it’s the history of the clubs that play there that we’ll be learning all about on our guided tours that will take us around the grounds and behind the seasons. Theis will include their trophy rooms which are around the most impressive (and largest!) you’re likely to see anywhere in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, there’s no way we can visit these two great cities without taking in some of the other incredible sightseeing opportunities whilst there. In Barcelona, we’ll be taken on a guided tour of the beautiful church of Gaudi’s La Sagrada Famila, the most iconic landmark in the whole of Catalonia. We’ll also be exploring the world famous gothic quarter and taking a stroll down Las Ramblas.  Likewise in Madrid, we will be receiving a guided tour of The Royal Palace, the largest palace in western Europe plus breathing in the big city atmosphere of Spain’s capital city.  We will also be travelling by train from Barcelona to Madrid, which brings with it the perfect opportunity to relax and enjoy some of the wonderful Spanish countryside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Come and join us for what is certain to be a holiday El Classico!!

            John Ryde
          </h2>
          <p>
            John Ryde has been married for over 40 years and lives in rural
            Dorset. He has two grown up daughters and, in the last two years, 3
            grandchildren. The grandchildren keep him fairly busy! For most of
            his life he was a secondary school science teacher and in recent
            years has really enjoyed working for Able2Achieve, a company that
            runs supported living placements and day provision for adults with
            learning disabilities and autism. John has organised and run
            numerous residential trips as a teacher and youth leader. John and
            his wife spent 6 years working with refugees and other disadvantaged
            people in northern Thailand, close to the Burma border. As part of
            their role in Thailand they helped to facilitate visiting teams.
            John has spent part of the last 4 summers with Go Beyond in France
            and Italy.
          </p>
          <p>
            John is also a Governor in a special school in Dorset. He is the
            link Governor for Safeguarding and the sixth form. He spends time in
            school as a volunteer in the sixth form most weeks. He has received
            recent training through Able2Achieve and Governor Services in
            safeguarding both for children and adults, medicines administration,
            first aid at work, the mental capacity act, epilepsy, autism and
            therapeutic behaviour management.

          <h2 class="sm-heading">A Few Questions to John Ryde</h2>
          <h3>What motivates and inspires you?</h3>
          <p>
            Seeing people, especially disadvantaged people, achieve their
            potential – going beyond what they thought was possible. I also love
            travelling to new parts of the world and getting to know their
            culture and food.
          </p>

          <h3>What are your strengths?</h3>
          <p>
            Years of life experience and finding myself in slightly stressful
            situations have taught me to stay calm and find a good way through
            anything. This is backed up by a practical/technical ability born of
            years of having to make do and mend mechanical and electrical things
            due to lack of money! As for people, I nearly always see their
            positives and enjoy working with them. I find this an amazing
            privilege. In recent years I have learned a tremendous amount about
            behaviour and how to manage it positively. I wish I had known what I
            now know when I was a Teacher!
          </p>
          <h3>What about your weaknesses, where do you need support?</h3>
          <p>
            I still think I’m in my thirties and not nearly 65, so I don’t
            always know when to slow down or rest. I normally wake early and on
            a GP holiday there is normally at least one early riser, so my day
            starts early. By the evening I am likely to fall asleep where I sit.
            Falling asleep in the evenings is certainly something that my wife
            would complain about.
          </p>
          <h3>What is the highlight of working for Go Beyond Holidays?</h3>
          <p>
            I love being a part of the Go Beyond family. There is a real sense
            that everyone, staff and guests, are welcomed into the group as a
            highly valued member. It is an amazing privilege to see guests
            overcome fears, grow in confidence and make new friends.
          </p>
          <h3>Do you have any personal ambitions?</h3>
          <p>
            To become a better musician. I really need to spend a lot more time
            practicing. I do enjoy performing, but could do with being a lot
            more professional. I would also love to get a glider pilots licence.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Finally, if you were set adrift on a desert island which three
            albums, three films, three books and one luxury would you take?
          </h3>
          <p>
            For music, I would have to take a Beatles album, probably the White
            Album, something classical like Handel’s Messiah and Tapestry by
            Carole King. My books would be Skallagrigg by Richard Horwood, I
            shall not hate by Izzeldin Abuelaish and a devotional book such as
            The Ignatian Adventure by Kevin O’Brien SJ. I’m not much of a film
            buff, but I would take The Book Thief, La Huiteme Jour and for pure
            escapism (and seeing someone sing worse than me) Mama Mia. As a
            luxury item I would take a guitar. I may even find the time to
            practice and become competent!

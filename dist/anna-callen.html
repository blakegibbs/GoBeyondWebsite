                <h2 class="sm-heading">Director and Administrator</h2>
                <p>
                    Anna Callen is one of the directors of Go Beyond and oversees the administrative side of the
                    holidays. She has lived in France for 18 years and has worked in a variety of roles including
                    teaching and administration. In her spare time, she enjoys hiking, baking, sewing and listening to
                    music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anna worked at The Olive Tree International School in Quinson teaching French and Spanish to
                    children with challenging behaviour. In Bristol, England, Anna spent half of her working week
                    working as Personnel Administrator for The Priory Hospital and the other half as a Translations
                    Coordinator for the charity Tearfund.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She lives with her husband, <a href="ian-callen.html">Ian</a>, and daughter, Poppy, in the Provençal
                    town of Manosque. Anna and
                    Ian’s other son and daughter are at university in England.

                <h2 class="sm-heading">A Few Questions to Anna Callen</h2>
                <h3>What motivates and inspires you?</h3>
                <p>I find inspiration in the simple things, for example, an amazing landscape will make me marvel at the
                    world’s natural beauty and make me want to go out walking and study the wildlife; a piece of music
                    combined with meaningful lyrics will provoke me to reflect on issues from a new angle as can a
                    beautifully written passage in a book.</p>
                <p>I am also inspired by some of the guests who come on our holidays, by their determination to achieve
                    in areas or activities that they find difficult and, most of all, by their positivity. I am
                    motivated by activities that lead me and those around me to feel they have achieved something
                    important to them.</p>
                <p>My sense of justice to see that people are treated fairly and have access to best opportunities is
                    also a source of motivation for me.</p>
                <h3>What are your strengths?</h3>
                <p>
                    I’m reliable, helpful and work well in a team.
                </p>
                <h3>What about your weaknesses, where do you need support?</h3>
                <p>Sometimes I am not very confident in my own abilities. I can be indecisive.

                </p>
                <h3>What is the highlight of working for Go Beyond Holidays?</h3>
                <p>Seeing an idea for a new holiday blossom into life. Hearing all the stories and testimonies of the
                    fun and fulfilling times had by everyone who has come on the holidays, including staff – that’s the
                    cherry on the cake!</p>
                <h3>Do you have any personal ambitions?</h3>
                <p>To spend more time creating objects that are either pleasing to the eye or useful, or better still,
                    both!
                </p>
                <h3>Finally, if you were set adrift on a desert island which three albums, three films, three books and
                    one luxury would you take?</h3>
                <p>Albums: Slow Dive – Slow Dive, LCD Sound System – American Dream, Courtney Barnett – Sometimes I Sit
                    and Think, Sometimes I Just Sit.<span class="new-line"></span> Books: The Great Gatsby by E. Scott
                    Fitzgerald, The Complete Collection of Inspector Morse by Colin Dexter, Jane Eyre by Charlotte
                    Brontë
                <div class="span new-line"></div>Films: Donnie Darko, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and Inception.
                Luxury item: A radio
                so that I can listen to music, culture programmes and comedies.</p>

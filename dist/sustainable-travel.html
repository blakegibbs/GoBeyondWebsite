                    Footprint
                </h2>
                <h3 class="bold">Our experience working with the regulations</h3>
                <p>
                    Did you know that at Go Beyond Holidays, we are committed to reducing our Carbon Footprint? After
                    all, we are a travel company and therefore travel A LOT!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, we have called upon the expertise of Léa Jacquot-Benson at Positively Touristing who aids
                    organisations within the tourist industry to calculate and offset their carbon emissions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working closely with Léa, she has set down some guidelines for us to follow. These have enabled us
                    to calculate our carbon footprint for 2025 and plan how much money we need to raise to donate to
                    projects that are involved with Carbon Offsetting.
                </p>
                <p>As recommended by Positively Touristing, we have chosen a local partner, close to where Go Beyond
                    directors, Ian and Anna, live in France. Therefore, we will be working with the Parc Natural
                    Régional du Verdon who will be using the money we raise to plant trees. This way we will be able to
                    visit and see for ourselves the progress that is made and, eventually, we hope to become involved
                    with helping to plant trees.</p>
                <p>The funds will be raised by a small amount paid for each holiday that we will be donating to the Parc
                    Natural Régional de Verdon. In addition, Go Beyond will contribute 50% towards monies raised by
                    funds generated from guests purchasing holidays. The money collected in 2025 from the holidays you
                    book, will be used to plant trees in the spring of 2026.</p>
                <p>We hope you agree with us that this is a small price to pay for our carbon emissions which are
                    harmful to the environment and act as an accelerator to climate change.</p>
                <p class="bold">Together we can do our part.</p>

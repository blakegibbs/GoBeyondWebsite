                    What's to get excited about!
                </h3>
                <p>There are many ancient myths that surround the Aurora Boralis or the ‘Norhtern Lights’ as we commonly refer to them.  Some say that the display are dragons fighting in the sky, other say that if you give birth under the beautiful night displays then child birth can be pain free and in Greenland, the mystics believed that the mysterious green lights are a ball game between people using a walrus skull as a ball.  The Northern Lights can inspire us in so many ways and we invite you to form your own interpretation by joining us in Tromso, Norway.</p>
                <p>
                    We will be staying in a cosy, seven bedroom house just south of Tromso on a fjord known as Ramfjord.  Just thirty minutes from the island of Tromso, nestled on the shores, we can enjoy the island known as the ‘Capital of the Northern lights’. By day it is a refuge of tranquillity packed with wildlife where we’ll be looking out for white tailed eagle, porpoise, orcas and sea otter. But of course, it’s the evening where true wonder occurs and from our house we will have the perfect vantage point to watch the skies for those magical lights. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our itinerary will include a visit to the original Norwegians, The Sami people, where we will learn about their culture, help to feed their flocks of reindeer and sit alongside them in their huts whilst eating a Sami traditional lunch around a cosy fire.  We will also be taking a trip from Tromso on a small boat, down the fjord with our friends at Polar Adventures.  On board, we will experience the stark beauty of the fjord from the water.  There’s a five-hour trip to enjoy, not least of all because it includes lunch with fresh fish …… caught by us!  
                </p>
                <p>
                    We’re delighted to announce that we will again be meeting back up with another friend of ours made over the years, Daniel from Flexitours. Daniel will give us a guided tour of Kvaloya, a neighbouring island of Tromso and will show us all the key parts of Kvaloya (which means Whale Island), including stunning deserted sandy beaches and will be preparing for us a wholesome lunch.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tromso itself is a wonderful place and we will take the time to stroll around this cosy town, visiting it’s cafes, shops and churches, all of which are surrounded by snow-covered Norwegian mountains.  We will also be taking guided tours of the Arctic Polaria and Perspektif Museums.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why not come and join us on a trip that will stay with you for an eternity!

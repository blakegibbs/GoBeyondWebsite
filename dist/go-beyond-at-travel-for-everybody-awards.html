            Go Beyond at The Travel for Everybody Awards
          </h2>
          <h3 class="bold">By Rachel Speed</h3>
          <p>
            Go Beyond had the enormous pleasure of going to an awards ceremony
            last week. We were shortlisted for Outstanding Achievement in
            Accessible Travel - Tour Operator at the inaugural Travel for Every
            Body Awards. Hosted by Selling Travel Magazine, the awards
            celebrated everyone in the travel industry who is trying to make
            holidaying and adventuring as inclusive and accessible as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Never one to turn down a free glass of champagne (or two) and some
            canapés, Kevin, our head of client relations and myself headed to
            Earl’s Court in London to enjoy the award ceremony.
          </p>
          <p>
            Canapes secured, we started chatting to other attendees about their
            companies, the work they get up to and the holidays they offer.
            There were many companies I’d never heard of there and it gave me
            the chance to go and look into them, as I hope many people there
            will look into the holidays Go Beyond has to offer as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            The judges of the awards were the esteemed group of: Sophie Morgan,
            accessible travel journalist and TV personality; Jonathan Fletcher,
            Founder of Wheelie Good Travel; Dr Amo Raju, author and disability
            charity specialist; Lady Tina Reading, Editor at Lube Media and
            accessibility consultant; Emma Partlow from Transreport; Paula
            Hansen, Founder of World Accessible Holidays; and Manuel Butler,
            from the Spanish Tourist Office.
          </p>
          <p>
            While we didn’t win the award, I’m so pleased we went along. It was
            a joyful afternoon meeting and celebrating different companies and
            individuals who are championing accessible travel. We often get a
            bit head-down in our own business and our focus is only on Go Beyond
            so what was marvellous to see is just how many other people have the
            same overarching ethos when it comes to making travel available for
            everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            I couldn’t stop grinning, clapping and cheering along as each winner
            was announced. I was so happy these awards took place. They shone a
            light on every company that was there and it promoted that
            accessible travel is out there for those who want it. It was a
            pleasure to be in such good company and we want to say a huge thank
            you to Selling Travel Magazine for inviting us, the judges for
            shortlisting us and the Mercure in Earl’s Court for hosting us. A
            wonderful afternoon!
          </p>

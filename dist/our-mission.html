                    <h3 class="bold">Approach and Philosophies</h3>
                    <p>Our main mission is to support our guests to achieve their goals as independently as possible
                        during
                        their holiday with us. We encourage our guests to embrace their white-water rafting trip with
                        excitement, we hope they learn those dance moves that they want to share with everyone and we
                        join
                        in their pleasure of photographing the stunning scenery in which we are immersed.
                        To foster that environment on our holidays, we undertake certain philosophies that are very
                        simple.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="bold">Respect</h3>
                    <p>Only support where needed; we will never be intrusive with our support of a guest. Many people
                        with good intentions offer support which, in the long run, doesn’t help the guest to progress.
                        <span class="new-line"></span>We treat each guest as an equal to ourselves and just because they
                        need support in certain areas, doesn’t mean they should be talked down to. We all need support
                        in our lives; many of us require support around car mechanics as we have limited knowledge in
                        that area, therefore we pay someone to support us with this, but do not expect to be patronised
                        when dealing with a mechanic. <span class="new-line"></span>We endeavour to give as much time as
                        we can to each guest and listen a lot. This is valuing people; valuing someone’s dreams, stories
                        and futures. We can aid in facilitating dreams as well as helping heal a hurt, just by
                        listening.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="bold">Organisational</h3>
                    <p>Our holidays are pitched at a level that will be appealing to anyone. Younger guests today want
                        the same experiences as their peers, like trekking in the mountains like their older siblings,
                        they want to see the Northern Lights in the land of fire and ice, just like their friends from
                        school did in their gap year and they want to experience the longest train ride in the world
                        that crosses the Siberian plains like they saw in a recent travel documentary on television. We
                        want them to experience this too.</p>
                    <p>As a team of staff we are always flexible and adapt to changes we may have to make to accommodate
                        someone’s needs that were not planned for. For example, someone who at the last minute may
                        decide that they do not wish to participate in an activity, like kayaking. This can be literally
                        as they are about to step into the kayak itself.</p>
                    <p>We pride ourselves on clear and regular communication between us and the care network of our
                        guests, to be able to ascertain the best care plan and risk assessment for the holiday. This
                        will help to create the best holiday possible that is fun, challenging, progressive but safe, a
                        very important element if we are to be trusted by the guest and their care network.</p>

          </h2>
          <p>Hello</p>
          <p>
            My name is Jessica Gamboa González. I was born and grew up in
            Mérida, Yucatán, Mexico, but moved to the UK after getting married
            and starting a wonderful family.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a daughter named Emily, and she is the light of my life.
            Watching her grow and be happy inspires me to share that happiness
            with those around me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I studied and graduated with a degree in psychology and worked in
            Mexico in various fields, including hospitals, a women&#39;s prison,
            special education, and cultural activities. All of this experience
            has allowed me to develop knowledge and put it into practice in my
            personal and professional life.
          </p>
          <p>
            I consider myself a cheerful, caring, and empathetic person, and I
            dedicate most of my time to caring for my daughter.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started working for Go Beyond in 2024 as a volunteer, and I can
            say that I fell in love with the experience. Working and being part
            of the happiness of guests on their holidays made me realize where I
            belong and what I want to do for a long time.
          </p>
          <h2 class="sm-heading">A Few Questions to Jessica Gamboa González</h2>
          <h3>What motivates and inspires you?</h3>

          <div class="text-list">
            <li>
              Definitely my family: my daughter, my husband, my parents,
              sisters, and friends. These are the people who have been with me
              throughout my life and have given me unconditional love.
            </li>
            <li>
              The people I&#39;ve worked with and currently work with. Each one
              is different, and each one teaches me and contributes their best
              to my life.
            </li>
            <li>
              Watching my daughter grow up is the reason I moved to the UK, to
              give her all the opportunities I know will one day allow her to
              enjoy life more than I have.
            </li>
            <li>
              I really enjoy daylight and the warmth of the sun. I grew up in
              the Mexican Caribbean, so I love warm weather, flavorful food, and
              cultural traditions.
            </li>
          </div>

          <h3>What are your strengths?</h3>
          <p>
            I consider myself a calm, empathetic person who is always thinking
            of others and who will help without expecting anything in return. I
            am a person who is not afraid to say what I think and feel and who
            doesn&#39;t give up at the first sign of trouble.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am consistent and sometimes creative. I don&#39;t usually talk
            much because I enjoy listening.
          </p>
          <h3>What about your weaknesses, where do you need support?</h3>
          <div class="text-list">
            <li>
              I have one-sided hearing loss and I am also learning to
              communicate in English, so sometimes I misunderstand conversations
              and don&#39;t always get what others are trying to tell me.
              However, I do my best in every situation and take my
              misunderstandings in stride.
            </li>
            <li>
              I am a very stubborn person; sometimes I need to listen to the
              advice of people who have more experience than me.
            </li>
            <li>
              I am very easily distracted; sometimes I get confused about
              situations because I&#39;m thinking about other things. I tend to
              overthink.
            </li>
          </div>
          <h3>What is the highlight of working for Go Beyond Holidays?</h3>
          <p>
            The opportunity to meet new people, make new friends, and be a part
            of their holidays. Also, the experiences in a different work
            environment; there&#39;s always kindness, enthusiasm, camaraderie,
            and above all, support. We all help each other; it&#39;s a great
            family that I&#39;m happy to be a part of.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love to travel, discover new places, and see the world from a
            different perspective. I love being part of this great family called
            Go Beyond Holidays. It&#39;s the best job I&#39;ve ever had.
          </p>
          <h3>Do you have any personal ambitions?</h3>
          <p>
            I would love to travel the world with my family. To experience new
            cultures, try new dishes, and learn new languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            I want to pursue my master&#39;s degree and, if possible, my
            doctorate in psychology.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also want to be a part of every stage of my daughter&#39;s life;
            there&#39;s nothing I enjoy more than watching her discover the
            world.
          </p>
          <p>And of course, I would love to travel to Mexico more often.</p>
          <h3>
            Finally, if you were set adrift on a desert island which three
            albums, three films, three books and one luxury would you take?
          </h3>
          <p class="bold">Albums:</p>
          <p>
            I would take the music from Tchaikovsky&#39;s Swan Lake, Ludovico
            Einaudi&#39;s music, and Latin dance music.
          </p>
          <p class="bold">Three films:</p>
          <p>
            I would take the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Ever After: A Cinderella
            Story, and the Kung Fu Panda trilogy.
          </p>
          <p class="bold">Books:</p>
          <p>
            If I were stranded on a desert island, I would take a medical
            encyclopaedia, a language book, and a survival guide—everything I
            need to survive and learn.
          </p>
          <p class="bold">Luxury item:</p>
          <p>
            I think the only luxury I would take with me would be a photo album
            of my family.
